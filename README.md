#My experiment framework
This is my own pipeline for constructing experiments.
Its goal is to get experiments up runnning as fast as possible.
As such only "simpler" models from scikit-learn are used.
For Deep Approaches (pytorch, tf), future repositories will be created.

#Libraries
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn




# Usage
I personally prefer to use something like experiment.py >> log.txt &, to log results.
An approach with a global file being written into during the whole experiment can also be used.
